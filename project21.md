# PROJECT 21: ORCHESTRATING CONTAINERS ACROSS MULTIPLE DRIVERS WITH KUBERNETS

Why migrate from Docker Compose to K8s

In the previous project you successfully deployed your Docker containers using Docker Compose, it is a great tool that helps avoiding execution of multiple CLI commands by preparing a declarative configuration file. It is handy when you deploy one or a few containers, but in most cases, it does not fit for production deployments.

Because of the many limitations that Docker Compose has, it is very important for us to consider migrating our solution to more an advanced technology. The most common alternatives to Compose, amongst a few others, are Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.

Container orchestration is a concept that allows to address these two scenarios, it provides automation of all the aspects of coordinating and managing containers. Container orchestration is focused on managing life cycle of containers and their dynamic environments.

It is about automating the entire lifecycle of containers running across multiple nodes:

    Configuring and scheduling of containers on nodes
    Ensuring the availability of containers, even when they die
    Scaling of containers to equally balance application workloads across infrastructure
    Allocation of resources between containers
    Load balancing, traffic routing and service discovery of containers
    Health monitoring of containers
    Securing the interactions between containers.

Tools to be used

- VM: AWS EC2
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 lts+
- Docker Engine
- kubectl console utility
- cfssl and cfssljson utility
- Kubernetes cluster

You will create 3 EC2 Instances, and in the end, we will have the following parts of the cluster properly configured:

- One Kubernetes Master
- Two Kubernetes Worker Nodes
- Configured SSL/TLS certificates for Kubernetes components to communicate securely
- Configured Node Network
- Configured Pod Network

> ### Step 0-Install client tools before bootstrapping the cluster.

- awscli – is a unified tool to manage your AWS services
- kubectl – this command line utility will be your main control tool to manage your K8s cluster. You will use this tool so many times, so you will be able to type ‘kubetcl’ on your keyboard with a speed of light. You can always make a shortcut (alias) to just one character ‘k’. Also, add this extremely useful official kubectl Cheat Sheet to your bookmarks, it has examples of the most used ‘kubectl’ commands.
- cfssl – an open source toolkit for everything TLS/SSL from Cloudflare
- cfssljson – a program, which takes the JSON output from the cfssl and writes certificates, keys, CSRs, and bundles to disk.
