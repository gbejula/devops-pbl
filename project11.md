  _Click Save_

- Go back to the Jenkins-in-Ansible project and click on 'Build now"

  _The build failed_

  _I discovered that the needed to change the branch to *main* instead of *master* since it has been changed by github_

  _The build was now successfully after the change_

- For the automatic build, changed the README.md file

- The build did not automatic trigger. I changed the files in the README.md four times but it still did not automatically trigger.

- Looked and discovered that the "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling" was not checked. Then, I checked the option.
